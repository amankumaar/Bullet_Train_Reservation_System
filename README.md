# Bullet_Train_Reservation_System

## Introduction:-
This software project is developed to automate the functionalities of an INDIAN RAILWAYS – Bullet Train Reservation System. 
The purpose of the software project is to develop the Management Information System (MIS) to automate the record keeping of Trains, Passenger Details, Train Schedules and Ticket Fare with a view to enhance the decision making  of the functionaries. 

A MIS mainly consists of a computerized database, a collection of inter-related tables for a particular subject or purpose, capable to produce different reports relevant to the user. An application program is tied with the database for easy access and interface to the database. Using Application program or front-end, we can store, retrieve and manage all information in proper way.
 
This software, being simple in design and working, does not require much of training to users, and can be used as a powerful tool for automating an INDIAN RAILWAYS – Bullet Train Reservation System.

During coding and design of the software Project, Java Net Beans IDE, a powerful front-end tool is used for getting Graphical User Interface (GUI) based integrated platform and coding simplicity. As a back-end a powerful, open source RDBMS, My SQL is used as per requirement of the CBSE curriculum of Informatics Practices Course.

## Objective & Scope of the Project:-

The project introduces railway reservation system with an objective to make the reservation system more efficient, easier and fast. This project explores how computer technology can be used to solve the problem of user.                                                                                                

1) The main objectives provided by this software are as follows:
2) It can Book and cancel passenger seats
3) It can enquire about the Ticket Fare, Train Schedule, and Reservation Chart.
4) User-Friendly

This project is dedicated to model existing Railway Reservation systems that aim at development of INDIAN RAILWAYS – BULLET TRAIN Reservation System that facilitates the railway employee to manage their passenger details and the railway administrator to modify the backend database in a user-friendly manner.
